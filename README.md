# mnist-net

This is a group project I worked on at Canada/USA Mathcamp in 2017. Over the course of a month, we collected images of campers' handwriting, processed the data, and trained a neural network on it. We also trained it on the MNIST dataset, which (by virtue of having much more data) was much more accurate, at around 95% rather than 70%. At the end of camp project fair, we set up a tablet where campers could write something and in real time, have our computer guess what digit it was.
